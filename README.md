# Data Visulaization for Ride Sharing Company, PyBer 

## Overview of the Data Analysis
This project revolves around analyzing large amounts of data to show relations between the type of city and the number of drivers, as well as percentage of fares by type city. The challenge uses Pandas library as well as Matplotlib to visualize the data to help PyBer improve access and affordibility to underserved neighbourhoods. 

## PyBer Ride Sharing Analysis Results

The data sharing analysis was mostly analyzed by the city type. A summary table is provided below:

A closer look was taken at the data from the January to April 2019 showing a graphical representation of the data as shown here:

![Weeks Summary](https://github.com/yaakoum/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/Pictures/PyBer_fare_summary.png)

Both the table summary and the graphical snapshot of the data in 2019 show:
- There is a much higher usage of ride sharing in Urban cities, followed by Suburban type cities, and lastly Rural. This can be seen in the total fares, total rides and total drivers. 
- The average fare per ride is highest in Rural type cities, that could be due to rides being generally longer rather than in Urban settings where things could be a lot closer together. 
- The average fare per driver is much higher for Rural type cities due to the lower number of total drivers. 
- The weeks summary for January to April also show that the fares for each type of city peak at different times of the year. For example, Urban type cities peak in March and taper off near April, while Suburban seem to peak end of February and taper off until Spring/April where it seems to be trending upwards again. Rural type cities seem to have just a few higher peaks but generally are pretty consistent during the first quarter of the year. 

## PyBer Ride Sharing Analysis Summary

After looking closely at the data here are 3 recommendations for PyBer: 

1. There are more Urban city drivers than there are total rides. It is recommended that PyBer invest in incentives to drivers to potentially work more in Suburban and Rural cities. As part of the advertisting PyBer can show a bar graph representing the average fare per driver for the 3 types of cities to incentivize drivers.

2. As timing for the incentives for drivers to move to other types of cities could be of question, it would be best for PyBer to incentivize near the end of the year as the begining of the year seems to be a lot less busy in Urban areas while Suburban cities could use the additional drivers. 

3. An alternative for Urban cities could be for PyBer to try and gain more total rides in Urban cities by having more discounts available in the times where there seems to be less total rides, such as January and end of April.
